# `build`

A lot of the files to build the Tachyons documentation are generated with build scripts.
All of those scripts and their source contents are found here.

There are two primary build pipelines, one for metadata that's shared throughout the site (like the latest Tachyons version or css stats).
The second for generating component documentation found at [`/components`](https://tachyons.io/components).
